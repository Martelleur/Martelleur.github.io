### Open Graph

* I have used the Open Open Graph protocol on my website. With Open Graph protocol, your web page can be a nice graph object for eg posts in facebook. To make your web page a grapph object, you need to enter metadata into your code. At the very least, these four properties must be included.

1. og:title
2. og:type
3. og:image
4. og:ur

* On my page I have included the following meta tags when using Open Graph protocol

```
    <meta property="og:title" content="Base1">
    <meta property="og:type" content="blog.programing">
    <meta property="og:url" content="https://martelleur.github.io/">
    <meta property="og:video" content="https://martelleur.github.io/assets/videos/Navras.mp4"/>
    <meta property="og:image" content="https://martelleur.github.io/assets/pics/matrix1.jpg">
    
```

* Instructions on how to use Open Graph Protocol can be found on their website.

<p>Pre-compiling css can be a bit confusing at first but when you get it right it is a smooth and fast tool to work with
when I made this site I used css <strong>Sass</strong> as pre-compiler.</p>

<p>The advantages with pre-compiling css is for me that it goes faster and that the files become easier to read.
The disadvantages are that pre-compiling can be confusing when you start using it.</p>

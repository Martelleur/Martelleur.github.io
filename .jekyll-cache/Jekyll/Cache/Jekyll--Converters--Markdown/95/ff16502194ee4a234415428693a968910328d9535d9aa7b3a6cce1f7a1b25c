<p>When I created this site I used static site generator for the first time, specifically I used <strong>jekyll</strong>. I am still a beginner in this field but really appreciate this as a tool for creating a static website.</p>

<p>Static site generators are good to use if you want to quickly create a static site for information to the clients, ie a site that displays the same content to every clients.</p>

<p>Pre-compiling css can be a bit confusing at first but when you get it right it is a smooth and fast tool to work with
When I made this site I used css pre-compiler.
The advantages for me are that it goes faster and that the files become easier to read.
The disadvantages are that pre-compiling can be confusing when you start using it.</p>
